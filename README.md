# My-First-Python-code-lines.
My first crack at learning Python
# First Python Data Project (Google Colab)

This project marks my first step into **Python programming**, completed using **Google Colab**. My focus was on learning the basics of Python syntax, data structures, and essential functions for data handling and analysis.

## 📚 Project Overview

In this project, I used Python to practice and understand:

- Variables, data types, and operators
- Control flow with `if` statements, `for` and `while` loops
- Built-in functions and custom function creation
- Lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets
- Basic error handling
- Working with data using libraries like `pandas` and `numpy`

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- 🐍 **Python Syntax Mastery**: Wrote clean, readable Python code using best practices
- 🧮 **Logical Thinking**: Used conditional statements and loops to automate logic
- 📦 **Library Use**: Imported and applied core libraries (`math`, `random`, `pandas`, `numpy`)
- 🔁 **Data Structures**: Created and manipulated lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples
- 🧑‍🍳 **Function Writing**: Built and tested reusable functions for different tasks
- 📊 **Data Handling Basics**: Loaded and previewed data using `pandas`
- ⚙️ **Colab Environment**: Leveraged Google Colab for code execution, notebook organization, and inline output

- ## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the `.ipynb` file in **Google Colab**
2. Step through each code block to follow the learning journey
3. Modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding
